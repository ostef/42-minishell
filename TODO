Ana:
* Signals
* Builtins:
	- export
	- unset
	- env

Stefan:
* Shell arguments

* ^C in heredoc
* Try to export vars like SHLVL, PWD, OLDPWD, HOME
* Ensure output is written at the right place
* Norminette!!
* Handle exit status on parsing error

Maybe:
* Log file so we can have the previous history
* $'PATH' in heredoc not behaving the same as in normal command line... (fuck that...)
* Rewrite quoted string handling in parsing (a"hello" should give ahello, not a hello!) ?
* Write line number in errors when we are not in a tty (see bash 2>err 1>out)
