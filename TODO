Ana:
* Builtins:
	- export
	- unset
	- env

Stefan:
* Norminette
* Compile with flags

* Handle errors on env parsing
* Handle exit status on parsing error

Error codes:
* Failed to open redir file: 1
* Syntax error: 2
* Command is not executable: 126
* Command not found: 127
* Fatal error of signal N: 128 + N
	- Program segfaulted: 139
* Script terminated by ^C: 130

Maybe:
* Handle segfault signals
* Shell arguments
* Log file so we can have the previous history
* $'PATH' in heredoc not behaving the same as in normal command line... (fuck that...)
* Rewrite quoted string handling in parsing (a"hello" should give ahello, not a hello!) ?
