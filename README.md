# Minishell
This is the minishell project from 42 school (subject version 6).  
This project was done by me and [aandric](https://github.com/Pipouye) in 2022, between February 24 and April 22, but was validated with a score of 100 way later on July 31.  
The program works better on Linux, on MacOS some signals don't work properly when waiting for user input in some cases, probably because of readline. We didn't bother fixing these issues because they were minor, and they required hacks.  
Reimplementing readline ourselves probably would have been a better thing to do.

This project also heavily relies on my [libft](https://github.com/ostef/libft) for parsing, string manipulation, printing, memory allocation, and other stuff.
